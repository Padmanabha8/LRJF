Three students (a, b, c) are arriving in the mess at the same time. The id numbers of these students are 2132, 2102, 2453 and the food taken time from the mess table is 2, 4 and 8 minutes. If the two students have same remaining time so it is broken by giving priority to the students with the lowest id number. Consider the longest remaining time first (LRTF) scheduling algorithm and calculate the average turnaround time and waiting time.

Longest Remaining Job First:

Step-1: First, sort the processes in increasing order of their Arrival Time.

Step-2: Choose the process having least arrival time but with most Burst Time. Then process it for 1 unit. Check if any other process             arrives upto that time of execution or not.

Step-3: Repeat the above both steps until execute all the processes.
